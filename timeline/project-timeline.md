## Alternative Publication Strategies

### Strategy 1: Rapid Preprint + Conference
**Timeline**: 2-3 days
- **Day 1-2**: Follow schedule above
- **Day 3**: Submit to arXiv/SSRN as preprint
- **Week 2**: Submit abstract to ACM FAccT, CHI, or similar
- **Advantage**: Quick visibility, conference presentation opportunity
- **Risk**: Less rigorous peer review initially

### Strategy 2: Journal Fast Track
**Timeline**: 3-5 days
- **Day 1-3**: Enhanced data collection and analysis
- **Day 4-5**: Comprehensive draft with extensive methodology
- **Target**: AI & Society, Digital Humanities Quarterly (fast review)
- **Advantage**: Peer-reviewed publication within 2-3 months
- **Risk**: Potential rejection requiring revision

### Strategy 3: Multi-Output Approach
**Timeline**: 3-4 days
- **Output 1**: Blog post/Medium article (Day 2)
- **Output 2**: Conference paper (Day 3)
- **Output 3**: Journal article (Day 4)
- **Advantage**: Multiple channels, broader reach
- **Risk**: More work, potential content overlap issues

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Timeline Risks
**Risk**: Insufficient data collection time
**Mitigation**: 
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Use existing datasets where possible
- Leverage pilot studies and preliminary data

**Risk**: Expert interview scheduling conflicts
**Mitigation**:
- Over-recruit participants (15 contacts for 8 interviews)
- Offer flexible scheduling options
- Prepare asynchronous alternatives

### Quality Risks
**Risk**: Rushed analysis leading to errors
**Mitigation**:
- Use established analytical frameworks
- Double-check all statistical calculations
- Have colleagues review key findings

**Risk**: Insufficient theoretical grounding
**Mitigation**:
- Focus on 3-4 core theoretical frameworks
- Use established concepts rather than developing new theory
- Ground in existing literature throughout

### Publication Risks
**Risk**: Rejection due to insufficient rigor
**Mitigation**:
- Target appropriate venue for scope and timeline
- Clearly acknowledge limitations
- Emphasize novel contributions and practical implications

**Risk**: Scooped by similar research
**Mitigation**:
- Focus on unique angle (philosophical + empirical)
- Emphasize practical framework development
- Submit to preprint server for priority
