# Research Design and Methodology

## Mixed-Methods Approach

### Quantitative Analysis
- **Survey Study** (n=500+): Public perception of AI-generated vs human narratives
- **Content Analysis**: Comparative linguistic/structural analysis of AI vs human stories
- **Citation/Impact Analysis**: Academic and cultural reception metrics

### Qualitative Analysis
- **Expert Interviews**: Authors, publishers, ethicists, AI researchers (n=20-30)
- **Focus Groups**: Readers' experiences with AI-generated content (n=6-8 groups)
- **Case Study Analysis**: Major AI storytelling implementations

### Philosophical Analysis
- **Conceptual Analysis**: Authenticity, creativity, authorship frameworks
- **Ethical Framework Development**: Normative guidelines for AI storytelling
- **Comparative Philosophy**: Cross-cultural perspectives on narrative authenticity

## Data Collection Timeline

## Research Variations & Alternative Approaches

### Variation 1: Computational Focus
- Natural language processing analysis of narrative patterns
- Machine learning classification of human vs AI text
- Semantic similarity mapping

### Variation 2: Cultural/Anthropological Focus
- Cross-cultural storytelling tradition analysis
- Ethnographic study of AI adoption in creative communities
- Historical parallels with previous technological disruptions

### Variation 3: Economic Impact Focus
- Market analysis of AI writing tools
- Professional displacement studies
- Economic modeling of creative industry changes

## Data Sources

### Primary Sources
- **Surveys**: Prolific, MTurk, social media distribution
- **Interviews**: Professional networks, academic contacts
- **Content**: GPT-generated stories, human-authored comparison texts

### Secondary Sources
- **Academic**: JSTOR, Google Scholar, ArXiv
- **Industry**: Publishing reports, AI company blogs
- **Cultural**: Book reviews, literary criticism, social media discourse

### Tools & Platforms
- **Survey**: Qualtrics, Google Forms
- **Analysis**: Python (NLTK, spaCy), R (tidytext), Atlas.ti
- **Interviews**: Zoom, Otter.ai transcription

## Validation Strategies

1. **Triangulation**: Multiple data sources and methods
2. **Peer Review**: Expert validation of frameworks
3. **Member Checking**: Participant validation of interpretations
4. **External Audit**: Independent researcher review

## Ethical Considerations

- IRB approval for human subjects research
- Informed consent for all participants
- Anonymization of sensitive data
- Fair use compliance for content analysis
- Transparency in AI tool usage
